        "Question: \"A 22-year-old man comes to the physician in October because of an 8-week history of an episodic rash. The last episode occurred three hours ago when he was swimming outdoors. During these episodes, he develops multiple pruritic raised and round red patches over his arms, legs, and chest. He reports that the symptoms resolve within an hour. He is a triathlete and has been training multiple times a day during the last two months. He says that he has often had to interrupt his training because of the rash. His family history is remarkable for asthma in his brother. He appears comfortable. His temperature is 36.5°C (97.5°F), pulse is 61/min, respirations are 13/min, and blood pressure is 116/74 mm Hg. His lungs are clear to auscultation. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Results of a complete blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are within the reference ranges. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management at this time?\" Key: \"Provocation and threshold testing\" Distractor: \"Direct antiglobulin test\" Distractor: \"No additional management is indicated at this time\" Distractor: \"Oral nifedipine therapy\" Distractor: \"Oral diphenhydramine therapy\" Explanation: \"This patient has had pruritic wheals for > 6 weeks following exposure to a particular stimulus, which suggests chronic inducible urticaria. \"Chronic inducible urticaria manifests after exposure to a specific trigger or stimulus (e.g., heat, cold, pressure, vibration, exercise). If chronic inducible urticaria is suspected, provocation and threshold testing should be performed to identify triggers and confirm the diagnosis. During provocation testing, patients are exposed to potential triggers and monitored for the appearance of urticarial lesions. Medications to treat symptoms, such as antihistamines and glucocorticoids, should be suspended for at least 3 days before initiating testing. Provocation tests help differentiate chronic inducible urticaria types, including exercise-induced urticaria, aquagenic urticaria, and cold urticaria, any of which could be causing this patient's symptoms. If cold urticaria is suspected, a cold stimulation test (e.g., ice cube test) should be performed to evaluate the patient's response. If a pruritic wheal develops, the test is considered positive, and the patient should undergo threshold testing with the TempTest to determine the highest temperature at which a reaction would occur. Threshold testing is not necessary for diagnosis but can help patients avoid potentially life-threatening situations (e.g., anaphylaxis when swimming in cold water). Treatment for chronic inducible urticaria includes trigger avoidance, patient education, and a second-generation H1 antihistamine regimen.\"\n",

Breast development is at Tanner stage I. Pelvic examination reveals normal pubic hair with clitoromegaly. A pelvic ultrasound shows ovaries with multiple cysts and a normal uterus.

The mother had virilization during pregnancy. These features are suggestive of low estrogen and high androgen levels. Individuals with aromatase deficiency are unable to convert androgens to estrogens. Therefore, karyotypically female (46 XX) patients are born with ambiguous external genitalia and present with female pseudohermaphroditism. Both males and females have normal internal genitalia. At the time of puberty, females fail to develop secondary sexual characteristics and typically present with amenorrhea (due to the development of ovarian cysts that impair ovulation) as well as features of virilization due to increased testosterone (e.g., severe acne, hirsutism). Mothers of affected children may develop similar features during pregnancy due to fetal androgens crossing the placenta. In addition to these abnormalities of sex development, females, as well as males, frequently have a tall stature due to a delayed fusion of the epiphyseal growth plates and signs of osteoporosis (e.g., bone fractures after minor trauma), caused by estrogen deficiency.\"\n",

She was born full term to a 31-year-old gravida 3, para 2 woman via normal spontaneous vaginal delivery after an uncomplicated pregnancy. She has been nursing intermittently since birth, and the mother is producing colostrum. During the past 5 hours, the infant has had multiple episodes of emesis that are becoming more frequent. The vomitus was initially clear with white-yellow streaks but is now green. The infant has urinated once but has not passed meconium.</p>\\\\n<p>On examination, the infant is initially lying quietly but then stirs and cries. She is afebrile and has a heart rate of 162 beats per minute and a respiratory rate of 43 breaths per minute. Her heart has a regular rhythm without a murmur, she has good femoral pulses, and her capillary refill is about 3 seconds. Both lungs are clear to auscultation. Her abdomen is soft and slightly distended without hepatosplenomegaly. Bowel sounds are diminished.</p>\\\\n<p>An abdominal radiograph is obtained (figure). An upper gastrointestinal series with small-bowel follow-through shows the duodenal–jejunal junction in the left upper quadrant, superior to the duodenal bulb, with no contrast beyond the proximal jejunum.</p>\\\\n<p>Which one of the following diagnoses is most likely in this case?</p> \"<p>x</p>\"\\nKey: \"<p>Jejunal atresia</p>\"\\nDistractor: <p>Malrotation with midgut volvulus</p>, <p>Hirschsprung disease</p>, <p>Pyloric stenosis</p>, <p>Duodenal atresia</p>\\nExplanation: . <p>This patient has symptoms of intestinal obstruction: bilious emesis, a distended abdomen, diminished bowel sounds, and failure to pass meconium. An abdominal radiograph shows dilation of the stomach, duodenum, and proximal jejunum — the triple bubble sign, suggestive of jejunal atresia. Intestinal atresias are thought to result from an in utero vascular incident that leads to bowel ischemia and reabsorption of the affected part of the intestine. Intestinal atresias of the proximal bowel (which include atresias of the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum) usually manifest with symptoms of bilious emesis and abdominal obstruction in the first 24 hours of life, as in this patient. If the affected area occurs between the ligament of Treitz and the jejunoileal junction, the condition is defined as jejunal atresia. The upper gastrointestinal series with small-bowel follow-through confirms this diagnosis, as contrast does not flow through the jejunum because of atresia in this section of the bowel. Surgery is required to restore bowel patency.</p>\\\\n<p>Malrotation of the midgut, midgut volvulus, and duodenal atresia are all in the differential diagnosis for bilious emesis but have been ruled out in this patient by the imaging results. In malrotation of the midgut, the duodenal–jejunal junction would not be in the appropriate place (i.e., in the left upper quadrant and superior to the duodenal bulb). In midgut volvulus, fluoroscopy would show malrotation and a corkscrew pattern of the proximal bowel. Finally, in duodenal atresia, the duodenum would not be distended or patent.</p>\\\\n<p>Pyloric stenosis manifests with emesis, but it is typically nonbilious and usually starts between 2 and 8 weeks of life.</p>\\\\n<p>Distal bowel obstruction, secondary to Hirschsprung disease or another pathology, usually manifests with failure to pass meconium in the first 24 hours of life. If distal bowel obstruction goes undiagnosed, the patient may present with bilious emesis after 24 hours of life.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\"lektorat\">Sentence(s) in this explanation repeated in other explanation(s)</span></p>\\\\n<p><span class=\"lektorat\">This patient has symptoms of intestinal obstruction: bilious emesis, a distended abdomen, diminished bowel sounds, and failure to pass meconium.

Patients with suspected euthyroid sick syndrome should undergo repeat thyroid function tests several weeks after they have recovered from their initial illness; in most cases, the test results are normal, and further evaluation for pituitary pathology is not indicated.</p>\\\\n<p>In this case, the patient’s repeat thyroid function test results were normal, so additional pituitary testing was not clearly indicated. However, the additional testing led to the incidental discovery of an elevated prolactin level. Given that this patient has no signs or symptoms of hyperprolactinemia or a prolactinoma, the most likely reason for the prolactin elevation is the presence of macroprolactin.</p>\\\\n<p>Macroprolactin — a large molecule (150–200?kDa) compared with monomeric prolactin (23 kDa) — typically consists of prolactin bound to immunoglobulin G. It is detected by most prolactin assays and, given its slower clearance from circulation, is present at higher serum levels than prolactin; it can therefore cause an elevation in prolactin levels.

These medications therefore lead to an uncoupling of blood glucose and insulin secretion; insulin secretion can continue even in the absence of hyperglycemia. This puts patients taking sulfonylureas at high risk for developing hypoglycemia.</p>\\\\n<p>Counterregulatory mechanisms are critical in preventing and correcting hypoglycemia. One of the counterregulatory mechanisms is an increase in gluconeogenesis (production and release of glucose) by the liver and kidneys. However, this process is inhibited by the presence of insulin. Therefore, the insulin produced by the pancreas in patients treated with sulfonylureas inhibits gluconeogenesis, further delaying the recovery from the hypoglycemic episode. In this patient, the unilateral nephrectomy may be an additional contributor. Renal gluconeogenesis accounts for approximately 20% of glucose production. A patient with chronic renal failure or who has undergone nephrectomy would, therefore, be at increased risk for hypoglycemia when taking sulfonylureas. In addition, glyburide is best avoided in patients whose glomerular filtration rate is &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, because decreased medication clearance also poses a risk for hypoglycemia.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\"wichtig\">Key learning point:</span> Counterregulatory mechanisms allowing for glucose release in the postabsorptive state include gluconeogenesis from both the liver and kidneys.</p> ###'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '\"Identify the most likely etiology of hypoglycemia in a patient with impaired renal function.\"'}]}, {'messages': [{'role': 'system', 'content': '\\n{\\n  \"instructions\": \"Generate one or a maximum of two learning objectives for a USMLE question bank question.

Several TNF inhibitors are approved for this purpose, including both etanercept and infliximab. Because immunosuppressive therapy can lead to reactivation of certain infections, patients should be screened for tuberculosis (TB), hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection before initiating TNF inhibitor therapy.</p>\\\\n<p>This patient tested negative for TB and HCV infection, but her HBV serologic studies — positive surface antigen, negative surface antibody, positive total core antibody, negative immunoglobulin M core antibody — suggest chronic HBV infection. She has no evidence of cirrhosis on examination, imaging, or laboratory testing.</p>\\\\n<p>Given the anticipated incidence of HBV reactivation in patients receiving TNF inhibitors (1% to 10%), the American Gastroenterological Association, American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, and American College of Rheumatology all recommend that patients starting TNF inhibitors also start antiviral prophylaxis if they have active HBV infection (characterized by positive hepatitis B surface antigen). The American College of Rheumatology further recommends antiviral prophylaxis for patients with active HBV infection who are starting other biologic DMARDs or targeted synthetic DMARDs such as JAK inhibitors.</p>\\\\n<p>Antiviral agents with a high barrier to resistance are preferred over lamivudine. Entecavir, a nucleoside analog used to treat HBV, has a high barrier to resistance and is commonly used for HBV prophylaxis in the setting of immunosuppression. Antiviral prophylaxis should be continued throughout TNF inhibitor therapy and for 6 months afterward.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\"wichtig\">Key learning point:</span> When a patient with chronic hepatitis B virus infection starts a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor for rheumatologic disease, concurrent antiviral therapy should be provided with a drug that has a high barrier to resistance.</p> ###'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '\"Choose an appropriate treatment regimen for a patient with hepatitis B virus infection who is starting immunosuppressant therapy for rheumatoid arthritis.\"'}]}, {'messages': [{'role': 'system', 'content': '\\n{\\n  \"instructions\": \"Generate one or a maximum of two learning objectives for a USMLE question bank question.

This is a common problem in older patients and in those with diabetes mellitus. The pattern seems to reflect a blunted response to hyperkalemia and has been described as hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism or designated type 4 renal tubular acidosis (RTA). In this disorder, the hyperkalemia is a more prominent issue than the nongap metabolic acidosis, which tends to be mild if present at all. This condition is the most common type of RTA.</p>\\\\n<p>Multiple medications interfere with the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone axis and can produce this pattern of electrolytes. For example:</p>\\\\n<p>• Beta-blockers and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs can blunt the release of renin.<br>\\\\n• Angiotensin-converting–enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers limit the release of aldosterone.<br>\\\\n• Heparin impairs aldosterone production.</p>\\\\n<p>The diagnosis of type 4 RTA is made on clinical grounds rather than measurement of renin and aldosterone levels. Also, importantly, even though the hyperkalemia suggests hypoaldosteronism, patients with this condition frequently have hypertension or edema, so use of a mineralocorticoid for treatment is not recommended. Thus, fludrocortisone, a synthetic analogue of aldosterone, might improve this patient’s serum potassium level, but it is likely to worsen his blood pressure and edema.</p>\\\\n<p>Instead, a thiazide diuretic, such as chlorthalidone, is the most appropriate therapy for this patient because it would not only lower his serum potassium level but also help reduce the volume overload evident on examination by hypertension and mild edema.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\"wichtig\">Key learning point:</span> The best next step in treating chronic hyperkalemia in a patient with type 4 renal tubular acidosis in the setting of type 2 diabetes and hypertension is initiation of a thiazide diuretic.</p> ###'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '\"Choose the most appropriate treatment for hyperkalemia in an older adult with type 2 diabetes and type 4 renal tubular acidosis.\"'}]}, {'messages': [{'role': 'system', 'content': '\\n{\\n  \"instructions\": \"Generate one or a maximum of two learning objectives for a USMLE question bank question.
